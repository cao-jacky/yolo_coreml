# YOLO with Core ML

This repo was forked and modified from [Ma-Dan/YOLOv3-CoreML](https://github.com/Ma-Dan/YOLOv3-CoreML). 

Key things:
1. I am testing with an iPhone 11 Pro Max, i.e., screen resolution and output is adapted for this phone
2. My plan is to update the model to use YOLOv4 or YOLOv4-tiny - my hope is to increase the FPS further from ~20/30 FPS to even higher
